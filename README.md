Social Anxiety Model
This project utilizes a synthetic social anxiety dataset to train and evaluate machine learning models aimed at predicting social anxiety levels. The model is developed using XGBoost and is exposed via a user-friendly Streamlit interface for easy interaction.

Features
Synthetic Social Anxiety Dataset: The dataset contains multiple features related to physical activity, sleep hours, caffeine intake, and more.

Machine Learning Model: The model is trained using XGBoost and evaluates accuracy and confusion matrix metrics.

Streamlit Interface: Users can interact with the model through a web interface powered by Streamlit.

Project Setup and Running Locally
Follow these steps to run the project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository
git clone <repository_url>
cd <project_folder>

2. Install the dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run app.py


I worked on a synthetic social anxiety dataset to predict social anxiety levels using machine learning models like XGBoost. You can now interact with the model through a Streamlit interface!
